                    <p>Connor has volunteered and worked for many wildlife organizations, most notably the American Eagle Foundation and the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center. He has taken his love of conservation and technology, combined it, and started helping many conservation organizations around the country develop and scale large conservation projects.

                    <h1>Kayla Jackson</h1>
                    <h2>Director of OAnimal Care & Training</h2>
                    <p>Kayla graduated from college with a degree in biology and a desire to see the world. Her travels eventually found her in Alaska, where she realized that animal care and conservation was a cause worth staying for. Since Alaska, she has traveled to Nepal where she developed an unparalleled love and respect for vultures. That interest in birds of prey took her to Tennessee and the American Eagle Foundation, where training became her primary interest and passion. While she specializes in caring for and training birds of prey, Kayla is dedicated to and eager to learn about any species she can. She believes training is an integral part of animal welfare and is excited to build relationships with the Alveus ambassadors to showcase their personalities and inspire dedication to their wild counterparts across an ever-growing online audience.</p>

                    <p>Lindsay graduated college with her Aquatic Biology degree, and her Master's in Conservation of Marine Predators and Coral Reef Conservation and Aquaculture. She always knew animals were her passion, and loves to travel as much as she can. This brought her to American Eagle Foundation where she grew a love for birds of prey. Meeting new people, it also took her to Alaska and the Midwest to work with a variety of birds. Since moving to Texas, she has grown to love all sorts of animals and loves to learn about them and tell anyone who will listen about them!</p>

                    <h1>Sruti Jamalapuram</h1>
                    <h2>Animal Care Coordinator</h2>
                    <p>Sruti graduated with a degree in Wildlife Sciences and a Master's in Biology with a focus on Animal Behavior. As a young volunteer at her local zoo, Sruti was fortunate to realize her passion for animal behavior, conservation, and environmental education. This passion translated to jobs all over the world, participating in field research and education. That trend continued when she moved to Michigan and served as the Mammal Curator for The Creature Conservancy. This opportunity channeled her interest in behavior into training, where she trained with animals both big and small for fear-free veterinary care, educational programs, and mental well-being. To further improve her training skills, Sruti studied and worked with K9 Turbo Training to obtain her certification in professional dog training. She specializes in fear and aggression and loves working with families to create a training environment that is supportive, engaging, and fun for everyone!

                        Building relationships with animals, continuing that relationship through time and training, and sharing that experience with others brings her a lot of joy - she is excited to do that alongside the Alveus community!</p>

After graduating with a degree in biology she started her career off as a zookeeper at Zoo Atlanta gaining the opportunity to work with a wide variety of hoofstock, primate, and carnivore species. Her love for educating and inspiring people to learn more about the animals in her care and their wild counterparts grew as well as her desire to build positive relationships with the animals she cared for. When the opportunity arose to work at Alveus, Amanda was beyond excited to be part such of an amazing online community united in the same goal of promoting conservation of our natural world.</p>
